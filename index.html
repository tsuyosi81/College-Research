                        From the time they are knee high, Mormons all around the world dream about coming to BYU. Most
                        men
                        and some women do a two-year stint as a missionary. Strongest academic programs are all
                        preprofessional. The atmosphere is generally mild-mannered and conservative, but BYU goes
                        bonkers
                        for its sports teams.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Brigham Young University’s strong ties with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints means that
                “BYU has high
                morals and a wholesome environment, which
                makes students feel safe and comfortable,” a senior says. A sense of spirituality pervades most
                everything at BYU, where
                faith and academia are intertwined and life is
                governed by a demanding code of ethics that has even led to the suspension of star
                athletes in mid-season. The strict Honor Code covers everything from dating practices to academic
                honesty; no-no’s
                include men wearing beards; the consuming of drugs, alcohol, and caffeinated tea and coffee (although
                caffeine in soda is allowed);
                and entering the bedroom of a member of the opposite sex. While students elsewhere might find the code
                burdensome, at
                BYU it is a point of pride. Indeed, the
                school’s commitment to church values is the reason most students choose it. “The
                students who attend BYU are unique,” says a communications major. “Everyone is
                clean-cut, shaven, modestly dressed, and proper in their etiquette.”
                <br>The church’s values of prosperity, chastity, and obedience are strongly evident
                on BYU’s 557-acre campus, where the utilitarian buildings, like everything else, are
                “clean, modern, and orderly.” The campus lies
                on the western edge of the Rocky Mountains,
                4,600 feet above sea level, between the shores of
                Utah Lake and Mount Timpanogos, offering
                breathtaking sunsets and easy access to magnificent skiing, camping, and hiking areas. Days begin early;
                church bells
                rouse students
                at 8 a.m. with the first four bars of the hymn “Come, Come Ye Saints.” (The same
                bells also peal every hour throughout the day.)
                The church’s influence continues when students set their schedules; students
                must take one religion course per term to graduate, and subjects include, of course,
                the Book of Mormon. In addition to an extensive liberal arts core, BYU requires
                students to demonstrate proficiency in math, writing (first-year and advanced), and
                advanced languages, a catch-all category that can be satisfied with coursework in a
                foreign language or in statistics, advanced math, or advanced music.
                <br>BYU’s academic offerings run the gamut, from liberal arts and sciences to preprofessional programs
                in
                engineering,
                nursing, business, and law. Students say
                the strongest offerings include education, exercise science, the Clark Law School,
                and most departments in the Marriott School of Business, especially accounting.
                There are also degrees in public health promotion and ancient Near Eastern studies. Brigham Young boasts
                campuses in
                Idaho and Hawaii, a center in Jerusalem,
                and a large study abroad program—nearly 200 programs in more than 50 countries. Approximately 90 percent
                of the men and
                40 percent of the women interrupt their studies—typically after the freshman year—to serve two years as
                a missionary.
                <br>Students agree that the academic climate is demanding. “It is competitive,” a
                senior reports, and “some courses are known for being extremely difficult to pass,
                such as American Heritage or Econ 110.” Freshmen are often taught by full-time
                professors, who generally get good marks. “Most professors have a passion for their
                subject and for teaching,” says a student. General education courses can be quite
                large, although 45 percent have fewer than 20 students, and registration can be a
                chore. The honors program, open to highly motivated students, offers small seminars with more faculty
                interaction and is
                “an excellent way to get more out of your
                college experience,” one participant says. The strength of the faculty is one reason
                BYU has more full-time students than any other church-sponsored university in the
                United States, almost all of them undergraduates.
                <br><br>Not surprisingly, the typical BYU student is conservative. “The students are
                very academically and spiritually minded,” confides a junior, who further describes
                students as “intelligent, friendly, and honest.” Thirty-three percent of BYU undergraduates are from
                Utah. Many others
                hail from California and Idaho, and 3 percent
                come from more than 100 other countries. Hispanic students contribute 6 percent
                to the student body, Asian Americans 2 percent, African Americans 1 percent, and
                multiracial students 4 percent. Tuition for church members is lower than for nonmembers, because
                Latter-day Saint
                families contribute to BYU through their tithes.
                Academic scholarships averaging $4,400 are available, as are roughly 250 athletic
                scholarships in 21 sports.
                <br><br> Nineteen percent of BYU undergrads—primarily freshmen—live in the
                singlesex residence halls. “The dorms are small but
                comfortable and very clean,” says a
                student. Upperclassmen typically opt for cheaper off-campus apartments, which are
                also single-sex (remember the Honor Code?). When it comes to food, the student
                dining outlets on campus are described as adequate. “The school provides decent,
                affordable on-campus meal plans,” says a senior. Although it is widely assumed that,
                because of the Honor Code and the religious tone on campus, sexual violence is not
                much of a problem, BYU drew national attention in 2016 after female students and
                alumni spoke out against the school’s practice of opening Honor Code investigations of students who
                report being
                assaulted. The protests resulted in a new policy
                of immunity for victims.
                <br><br>Whether it’s work with the homeless or disabled, dances, firesides, concerts,
                plays, sporting events, or special activities within the campus religious wards (small
                groups of about 100 students), most of BYU’s social life is organized through or
                linked to the church. Community service is big, with students visiting patients at
                hospitals and care centers, performing at local festivals, and building and refurbishing houses. Social
                life
                is carried out within the church’s bounds of propriety
                and is given a lighthearted feeling with groups that
                encourage “creative dating and lots of dating, period,” says a senior. There are no
                fraternities or sororities to provide housing or parties, which is just fine with most
                students, since alcoholic drinks are banned. Road trips include Vegas or southern
                Utah and, with the mountains being so close, you’ll find plenty of skiing and camping. Provo itself has
                plenty of places
                to eat and shop. “Provo wouldn’t really exist
                without BYU,” says a student, and “it’s a good college town for people who don’t
                like bustling metropolises.”
                <br><br>Physical fitness is big here, and the intramural facilities are some of the country’s best, with
                indoor and outdoor
                jogging tracks; courts for tennis, racquetball,
                and handball; and a pool. Also important are varsity sports. The church philosophy of discipline and
                obedience has
                worked wonders for Cougar teams, and the
                football rivalry against the University of Utah provides some serious end-of-season
                intensity—the ESPN television network has dubbed the BYU–Utah rivalry the “Holy
                War.” One of the most popular courses offered at BYU is ballroom dancing, partly
                because many participants aspire to join BYU’s award-winning dance team.
                To most Americans, BYU probably seems old-fashioned or like a step back in
                time. But for young members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
                that may be just what the elder ordered. “BYU’s dedicated faculty, devout atmosphere, and beautiful,
                clean campus set it
                apart from all other universities,” a satisfied senior says.

                        Not quite as highly rated as the University of Michigan or the University of Wisconsin,
                        but not nearly as expensive if you happen to be from out of state. In a university the
                        size of Minnesota, the best bet is to find a niche, such as the honors program. Strong
                        programs include engineering, management, and health fields. Pack your woollies.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                The University of Minnesota, like the nearby Mall of America, can be overwhelming,
                given its seemingly limitless variety of offerings and gargantuan size. With 150
                undergraduate majors across seven schools and colleges, plus one of the largest
                study abroad programs in the nation, the U of M offers an abundance of academic
                choices. Be warned, though—winters can be frigid and it can take a cool customer to
                navigate the endless choices here.
                <br><br>The vast Twin Cities campus actually consists of two campuses with three main
                sections. The St. Paul campus encompasses the College of Food, Agricultural, and
                Natural Resource Sciences; the College of Biological Sciences; the College of
                Veterinary Medicine; and the College of Continuing Studies. The Minneapolis
                campus is divided by the Mississippi River into an East Bank and a West Bank that
                are home to the other colleges and most of the dormitories, as well as most of the
                fraternities and sororities. Both campuses offer a
                blend of traditional and modern architecture,
                with columned buildings seated next to sleek geometric structures. The two campuses are five miles
                apart and linked by a free bus service. Academic facilities are excellent, beginning
                with the seven-million-volume library system, one of the largest in North America.
                Every one of the colleges has its own library, many of which are good places to
                study. A 695-acre arboretum is used for research and teaching, and the West Bank
                Arts Quarter makes a lively setting for the university’s art disciplines.
                <br><br>Minnesota’s liberal education requirements call for students in all schools and
                colleges to complete a set of basic distribution requirements and take courses that
                satisfy four of five themes: civic life and ethics, U.S. diversity and social justice, the
                environment, global perspectives, and technology and society. Freshmen must take
                a first-year writing course. The College of Science and Engineering is notable for its
                tutorial and internship options; the electrical and mechanical engineering programs
                are particularly strong and well subscribed. The Carlson School of Management is
                well regarded and offers majors in entrepreneurial management, international business, and other areas.
                Psychology,
                communication studies, journalism, and computer science are the most popular majors. Undergraduates also
                have access to
                more
                esoteric fields such as mortuary science.
                <br><br>“The classes are relatively difficult,” a junior says, but “it really depends on
                the subject.” The university is on a semester system, and almost all classes have a
                pass/fail option (limited to no more than a quarter of a student’s courses). Efforts
                to limit class size have been stepped up—37 percent of classes currently have fewer
                than 20 students—and the university is focusing more on undergraduates. While
                undergrads have had a difficult time enrolling in courses, one junior reveals, “If a
                class is closed and somebody really needs it, they can usually get a magic number
                from the department to be able to register for it.” The university also offers a
                four-year graduation guarantee, provided students follow program requirements,
                including frequent academic counseling and specific coursework. Helpful teaching assistants are
                abundant. Professors
                receive high marks from most students as being approachable and knowledgeable. “The instructors have
                been exemplary
                due to their passion for the subject matter and commitment to their students,” an
                archaeology major says.
                <br><br>The excellent honors program in the liberal arts college allows close contact
                with faculty members as well as leeway to enroll in certain graduate courses and
                seminars. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program provides scholarships of up to $1,500 for
                students to conduct
                research with faculty. Students find
                plenty of internship opportunities at the many corporations and government agencies in the Twin Cities
                area, and the
                university pushes its study, work, and volunteer
                abroad programs in nearly 100 nations. These draw about a third of undergrads,
                most of whom sign up for short-term programs.
                <br><br>Most U of M students are “motivated and hardworking,” says a junior. Seventytwo percent of
                undergraduates are from
                Minnesota, and 9 percent hail from outside
                the U.S. Five percent are African American, 4 percent are Hispanic, 10 percent are
                Asian American, and 4 percent are multiracial. Need-based financial aid is available,
                as are merit scholarships averaging $5,000 and athletic awards in all major sports.
                <br><br>Dorm life at Minnesota follows the big school, wait-in-line mantra. Twentythree percent of
                undergraduates live in
                residence halls; there are nine traditional
                halls and five university-run apartment facilities.
                Students can also choose to join one of three dozen
                living/learning communities, such as Design House,
                STEM Diversity House, and Lavender House. “Dorms are adequate,” says one student, although “some can be
                a bit cramped.”
                Dorm rooms are hard to obtain, and
                parking spaces for the school’s many commuters are almost as scarce. Students who
                have rooms get the chance to keep them for the next year, and they’re also required
                to purchase a meal plan. Meals are said to be hit or miss, but, “Fresh fruit and veggies
                are always available,” notes a junior, who also adds (lest anyone fear the campus
                dietitians are excessively health-obsessed), “they have the best chocolate chip cookies.” Campus
                security includes a
                free escort system.
                <br><br>“Most social life takes place right off campus,” says one student, “but there are
                loads of activities available on campus, such as bowling, theater, late-night activities,
                and movies.” About 12 percent of students go Greek. Students say policies against
                underage drinking usually work. The union’s bowling alley, pool tables, movie theater, and live music
                dance club are
                good places to meet people. And there are more
                than 900 student groups on campus. Spring Jam, a carnival weekend put on by the
                Greeks each April to raise funds for charity, is a huge event, described by one student
                as “homecoming in spring—but better.” Campus Kickoff Days in the beginning of
                the fall quarter is also much anticipated.
                <br><br>Here, being “under the weather” can be a good thing, as campus designers found
                a way to get around—or under—wet or wintry conditions by linking many of the
                campus buildings with tunnels. For those who love winter, happy skiers and skaters
                become colorful spots all over the state’s white backdrop. In the spring and summer,
                Minnesota’s famed 10,000 lakes offer swimming, boating, and fishing. The downtown areas of the Twin
                Cities are easy to
                get to by bus, and there are scores of good
                bars, restaurants, nightspots, and movie theaters.
                <br><br> This is an athletically inclined bunch of students, as both intramural and
                Division I varsity sports are popular. Students always hope the current season will
                be one in which the gridiron Gophers take home the roses in a bowl victory, but
                short of that, a win over Michigan for custody of the Little Brown Jug is cause for
                celebration. Women’s ice hockey has scored four national championships in the last
                eight years. Men’s ice hockey, baseball, and women’s soccer, softball, and track and
                field have all won Big Ten conference titles in recent years. Intramural competition
                can go on well past midnight.

                <h3><u>Purdue University</u></h3>
            </div>
            <p><strong><i>
                        Purdue is Indiana’s STEM university—with side helpings of business, health
                        professions, and liberal arts. Compare to Kansas State and Big Ten rival Michigan
                        State. Does better than most large universities in giving students hands-on
                        opportunities such as internships and co-ops. Flight technology and aerospace—and
                        turning out future astronauts—are longtime specialties.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Successful Indiana colleges typically have three things in common: a solid agricultural program, a
                powerhouse basketball
                team, and a conservative student body.
                Purdue University has all of these—plus one of the nation’s strongest engineering
                programs, and the distinction of having awarded more bachelor’s degrees in the
                field than any other institution. Purdue is also home to the nation’s first computer
                science department, and its programs in pharmacy, nursing, and management are
                top-notch. Budding classicists, dramatists, and literary critics might want to look
                elsewhere, but those seeking small-school friendliness with big-school spirit may be
                very happy to join the ranks of Boilermakers.
                <br><br>Purdue is the main attraction in the small industrial town of West Lafayette,
                where the population triples when students return each fall. The campus features
                redbrick and limestone buildings arranged around lush shaded courtyards. Recent
                construction includes the $90 million Honors College and Residences facility.
                Purdue is also home to Amazon.com’s first ever brick-and-mortar location, where
                students can have textbooks shipped overnight for no cost.
                <br><br>Students apply to and enroll in one of Purdue’s 10 colleges, and academic
                requirements vary by school and major. Typically, they include English, math, a lab
                science, and foreign language proficiency. Management is the most popular major, followed by mechanical
                engineering, computer science, and industrial engineering.
                Students flock to the five-year engineering co-op program, one of the most competitive on campus,
                because it marries
                classroom study with real-world work.
                Additionally, Purdue offers a strong undergraduate program in professional flight
                technology, which includes hands-on training at the university’s own airport.
                Purdue has produced more than 20 astronauts, including pioneers Neil Armstrong
                and Gus Grissom. A four-year program in retail management is available in partnership with the Fashion
                Institute of
                Technology
                (FIT) in New York. For those seeking to save
                money on their degree and pursue their postgraduation plans sooner, Purdue offers nearly
                20 “Degree in 3” programs in the colleges of Liberal Arts and Education through
                which students can earn a bachelor’s degree in three years; options range from communication and history
                to sociology
                and special education.
                <br><br>“The academic climate is fairly competitive and intense,” says a sophomore.
                Despite the university’s size, 38 percent of classes have fewer then 20 students and
                many freshman classes are seminar-style, taught by graduate students and academic
                advisors who help answer students’ questions and provide career advice. “I’ve had
                some teachers who were phenomenal at connecting with the students and having
                them understand the concepts,” one student confides, “and other teachers act like
                they are presenting to an empty room.” Twenty-three percent of students study
                abroad, and options are available for students in all majors in more than 60 countries. Undergraduates
                also participate
                in more than 2,000 research projects each year.
                <br><br>“The students here are very academically focused and driven,” says a junior.
                “They have fun and relax on weekends, but everyone knows the reason we are here
                is to get a degree to be successful in the future.” Fifty-three percent of undergraduates are from
                Indiana, although
                there is a healthy proportion of international students, at 16 percent. Four percent are African
                American, 9 percent are
                Asian
                American, 6 percent are Hispanic, and 3 percent are multiracial. A tuition freeze
                has been in place since 2013, helping to keep costs down. Thousands of merit
                scholarships averaging $5,300 are awarded annually; athletes vie for 216 scholarships in 18 sports. The
                Purdue Promise
                program grants financial assistance and
                specialized academic and leadership coaching to eligible Indiana residents from
                lower-income backgrounds.
                <br><br>Forty percent of students live in Purdue’s residence halls; the numbers may be
                so low because of rules governing male and female visitation hours. (The notion of
                a “co-ed dorm” here means that both sexes share a
                lobby.) Almost all freshmen live on campus, though
                they aren’t required to, and Harrison Hall is said to be
                a good pick for newbies. “Some are definitely nicer
                than others,” a sophomore admits. “Many of them still do not have air-conditioning.”
                Most upperclassmen find inexpensive housing just off campus. Those with a grumbling stomach are treated
                to tasty options
                on campus. “Our food is fantastic,” cheers
                one junior. “It’s all-you-can-eat.” Walking and riding escorts and a visible security
                presence help students feel safe.
                <br><br>“The social life typically takes place on campus,” reports one philosophy
                major. Alcohol is prohibited in dorms, and “people have been kicked out of the
                residence halls for being caught with alcohol,” says a sophomore. Still, as at other
                schools, underage students can find ways to get served. Greek life draws 21 percent
                of Purdue men and 23 percent of the women and offers many social opportunities. But there are other
                options too,
                including sports games and more than 1,000
                student organizations, ranging from the BBQ society to professional development
                clubs. “Outside of class, you can do anything from skydiving, paintball, choir, rock climbing, salsa
                dancing—anything. It’s up to you,” encourages a senior mechanical
                engineering major.
                <br><br>As far as college towns go, West Lafayette “would not exist if it weren’t for Purdue,”
                one student says. Another adds, “The surrounding area has a good social scene for
                those 21 [and over], with excellent bars and nightlife. There are also many great nearby
                restaurants within walking distance for all students.” Harry’s Chocolate Shop—a bar,
                not a candy store—is a longtime student favorite. Chicago and Indianapolis are favored
                weekend destinations for students with cars, and each spring, a week of fun and parties
                leads up to the Grand Prix go-kart races. Students also look forward to the Bug Bowl,
                an annual event sponsored by Purdue’s entomology department, including cricketspitting and cockroach
                races.
                <br><br>Purdue’s “Boilermaker” moniker was coined by a sportswriter in 1891 describing
                how “the Burly Boiler Makers from Purdue” defeated Wabash College’s football team
                44–0. Boilermaker pride manifests itself at Division I games of all types, especially when
                the opposing team is Indiana University, known derisively as “that school down south,”
                in the annual struggle for the Old Oaken Bucket. Every year, the winner adds a link to
                a chain on the bucket in the shape of either an “I” or “P.” Men’s basketball, women’s
                golf, and men’s and women’s swimming and track and field are among the most competitive sports on
                campus. Thirty-four
                club sports and more than 40 intramurals are a
                big draw for those looking for friendly competition. Solar car racing and Rube Goldberg
                machine contests are some of the more popular activities among STEM students.
                <br><br>Happy students here have discovered that learning is fun when academics are
                mixed with real-world experience and a healthy dose of school spirit. “Purdue has
                great academic programs, incredible organizational and social opportunities, and
                an awesome sense of community,” says one enthusiastic sophomore. “Boiler Up!”

            <p><strong><i>
                        The only small, selective, private college in the Chicago area, Lake Forest generally
                        attracts middle-of-the-road students. In the exclusive town from which the school
                        takes its name, students can babysit for corporate CEOs at night and get internships
                        at their corporations during the day. Large numbers of Foresters also study abroad.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Located just 30 miles north of the downtown Loop, Lake Forest College offers excellent programs in
                business,
                communication, and psychology, along with abundant
                opportunities for study abroad and professional internships at Chicagoland organizations such as the
                Chicago Blackhawks,
                the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Shedd
                Aquarium. Academic improvements at Lake Forest are drawing attention and the
                school is shedding its image as a haven for spoiled rich kids; applications are up significantly and the
                school is
                attracting high-caliber students from around the nation.
                <br><br>With its mixture of century-old Gothic and modern glass structures, Lake
                Forest’s 107-acre campus is storybook beautiful. Located on Chicago’s North Shore
                in a wealthy, quiet suburb of 20,000, the campus has three contiguous parts divided
                by natural wooded ravines: North, Middle, and South. Each has a mix of residence
                halls and academic buildings. The state-of-the-art Donnelley and Lee Library offers
                a 24-hour computer lab, “smart” classrooms, and space where students can work
                collaboratively on projects. Recent campus projects include the $43 million, interdisciplinary Lillard
                Science Center.
                <br><br>General education requirements include the First-Year Studies Program, featuring “very small
                classes
                designed to help
                freshmen integrate into the college,” says an
                English major. “These courses are writing
                intensive and offer a variety of opportunities,
                including trips to Chicago for plays and
                museum visits.” Students also complete two
                credits in each of three liberal arts areas (humanities, social and natural sciences, and
                math), two cultural diversity courses, and a senior studies capstone course.
                <br><br>Students say Lake Forest’s best and most popular majors include business,
                finance, psychology, biology, communication, neuroscience, and English. An
                entrepreneurship and innovation minor has also proven popular. Accelerated and
                dual-degree programs—including three-year degree programs in philosophy and
                communication and dual-degree programs in law, engineering, pharmacy, accounting, and international
                studies—are
                available. Academic self-starters benefit from the
                self-designed major program, which allows undergrads to create their own majors
                outside the boundaries of traditional disciplines.
                <br><br>The academic climate at Lake Forest is described as collaborative. “The small
                class sizes allow for a lot of group discussion, group projects, and peer mentoring,”
                says a biology major. “It’s not uncommon to find an entire class sitting in a study
                room going over material for an upcoming exam.” Foresters especially enjoy the
                large doses of individual attention that they receive from the faculty. “The professors here know my
                name, they know what I struggle with, and they know my strengths,”
                confirms a psychology major. The Career Advancement Center is run by the same
                person who oversees admissions, meaning that the person who brings you to Lake
                Forest is also looking out for you as you graduate and move into the workforce. The
                center offers symposia, workshops, and résumé clinics, and students benefit from
                the college’s proximity to downtown Chicago, just an hour away by train. Many
                pursue term-time internships in the city’s business district, known as the Loop, or at
                nonprofits and other organizations in surrounding communities.
                <br><br>Study abroad is integral to the Lake Forest experience, and 40 percent of students travel via
                more than
                200 programs in
                approximately 70 nations. Participants
                in the faculty-led Lake Forest College in
                Greece program spend half a semester on
                campus studying the ancient Aegean world,
                then travel to Athens to take coursework on
                classical and modern Greece and visit archaeological sites and museums. Each year, about 40 students
                become Richter
                Apprentice
                Scholars, living together, working in a 10-week paid research assistantship during
                the summer before their sophomore year, and taking part in a weekly student/
                faculty colloquium. “Absolutely try to do research with your professors,” urges a
                communication major. “It is the most rewarding thing you can get involved with.”
                <br><br>Sixty-two percent of Lake Forest students hail from the Land of Lincoln. A sophomore counsels
                that at a
                small school
                where everyone knows everyone, “It’s important
                to be open-minded, amiable, and able to get along with others.” African Americans
                make up 6 percent of the student body, Hispanics 15 percent, Asian Americans 6
                percent, and multiracial students 4 percent; 8 percent are international. Although
                the school organizes frequent panels and open-forum discussions on political and
                social issues, students say political debate is usually mild on this relatively moderate
                campus. Competitive financial aid packages are helping to bring more students of
                color and those from less-advantaged backgrounds to Lake Forest. Thirty-one percent of freshmen are
                eligible for Pell
                Grants. The college awards numerous merit
                scholarships averaging $23,100 but does not offer athletic awards.
                <br><br>Seventy-five percent of students live in the dorms, which they are required to do
                through their junior year. An English major says, “Different halls attract different
                people. I preferred living in the older buildings because they felt homier than the new
                buildings, which felt more like a hotel.”
                Housing selection for upperclassmen is prioritized by seniority and GPA, “so there’s a definite
                incentive to do well in
                your
                classes,” says a senior. A fair number of students commute from home, and many
                seniors choose to stay on campus due to high rents in the surrounding area.
                Everybody eats in the central dining hall, where food is prepared to order at pizza,
                pasta, stir-fry, and other stations, and helpings are unlimited. “Our dining hall is
                multicultural, so you can have Mexican food one day and Indian the next,” explains
                a sophomore. A senior says, “We have regular programming events and student
                panels dedicated to educating the campus on sexual assault.”
                <br><br>“The social life on campus is always active because a majority of students live
                on campus and are involved in multiple organizations,” says a biology major. The
                Campus Entertainment Committee books movies, comedians, and big-name bands,
                while the Garrick Players also put on several productions per year. The school’s
                three fraternities and five sororities attract 17 percent of the men and 18 percent of
                the women, respectively, and though they don’t have houses, their parties are open
                to all. Students say the party culture is relatively low-key, and underage students
                caught drinking on campus are strictly penalized. Everyone enjoys the semiformal Winter Ball, the annual
                Forester Day of Service, the Spring Concert, and the Drag
                Show lip-synch contest planned by PRIDE.
                <br><br>The town of Lake Forest is wealthy and mostly residential, and one student says,
                “The town is actually in a forest, so the whole place is beautiful, and it feels like you
                live tucked away in a safe haven.” There’s a commuter train station five minutes
                away and the Lake Michigan beach is just as close. The college also offers a weekend
                shuttle service to local malls and movie theaters, though a car is helpful. Several
                student organizations are devoted to community service, and Greek organizations
                sponsor blood drives, bake sales, and car washes. One program sends students to the
                Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and Tennessee every spring break to help local
                townspeople repair substandard housing.
                <br><br>Division III Foresters athletics have begun to draw more attention from students. Recent Midwest
                Conference champions
                include men’s golf and soccer and
                women’s softball. Club and intramural sports programs are plentiful; lacrosse, rugby,
                and indoor soccer are especially popular.
                <br><br>Although Lake Forest still has its fair share of preppy types, students are quick to
                emphasize that the college is taking steps to increase diversity, foster a collaborative
                atmosphere, and encourage school pride. “Lake Forest takes very good care of its
                students by providing challenging academics, comfortable living, lots of entertainment, and a small-town
                feel with
                access to a big city,” concludes a senior. “What
                more could anyone want?”

                <h3><u>DePaul University</u></h3>
            </div>
            <p><strong><i>
                        Few universities have come so far, so fast. DePaul gets the nod over Loyola as the top
                        Roman Catholic university in Chicago. Its Lincoln Park setting is like a Midwestern
                        version of New York’s Greenwich Village or Upper West Side. About one-third of
                        undergraduates who report a religion are Catholic. Especially strong in business,
                        public relations, film, and the performing arts.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                DePaul University is the largest Roman Catholic university in the nation. Students
                claim the university’s diversity and politically liberal leanings set it apart from rival
                institutions. Based in the heart of the city, DePaul is a feeder to Chicago’s business community. A
                spate of campus
                construction has transformed it from the “little
                school under the El” to Chicago’s version of NYU. DePaul inaugurated its first lay
                president in 2017.
                <br><br>DePaul, which was founded by Vincentian fathers in 1898 and is named after
                the 17th-century French priest Vincent de Paul, has two residential campuses. The
                Lincoln Park campus, with its state-of-the-art library and student center, is home to
                the colleges of liberal arts and social sciences, education, and science and health; the
                theatre and music schools; and residence halls and recreational facilities. Lincoln
                Park itself is a fashionable Chicago neighborhood with century-old brownstone
                homes, theaters, cafés, parks, and shops. The Loop (or “vertical”) campus is 20 minutes away by elevated
                train (a.k.a.
                the El) in downtown Chicago and houses the colleges of business, communication, computing and digital
                media, and law, as
                well as
                the School for New Learning. The DePaul Center, a $70 million teaching, learning,
                and research complex, is the cornerstone of this campus.
                <br><br>All freshmen take a course called Discover Chicago or its alternative, Explore
                Chicago, which introduces them to the city. “This class is one of the best things
                about DePaul. It’s really fun and valuable,”
                says a senior. Other common core courses
                include composition and quantitative reasoning for freshmen, a sophomore seminar on
                multiculturalism in the United States, and an experiential learning program that
                requires an internship, research, study abroad, or service-learning experience. In
                their senior year, students create a final project.
                <br><br>DePaul’s name is closely associated with Midwestern business and law, and
                undergraduates can find internships year-round with local legal and commercial
                institutions. The School of Accountancy and MIS is reported to be the most challenging department in the
                Driehaus
                College of Business. The College of Science
                and Health offers a health sciences program that prepares students for a variety
                of health care professions, and the Pathways Honors Program provides top students with specialized
                prehealth advising
                and summer research opportunities. The
                School of Cinematic Arts has teamed up with Cinespace Chicago, the city’s premier
                movie studio, to create a learning environment that provides students with film and
                television production experience in the midst of a working studio. Other notable
                programs include game design and animation. Combined, six-year bachelor’s/law
                degree options are available in several fields, ranging from economics to Islamic
                world studies, and a number of five-year bachelor’s/master’s degree programs are
                also offered. The most popular majors include public relations and advertising,
                finance, accounting, and psychology.
                <br><br>“The courseload is rigorous at times, but if a student is dedicated to their studies,
                it is nothing that can’t be handled,” says a senior. Classes are often small, with 41
                percent enrolling fewer than 20 students, and professors teach at all levels. The
                administration appoints student representatives from each school and college to
                faculty promotion and tenure committees. “DePaul professors are respectful, intelligent, and don’t put
                up with
                nonsense,” says one senior. Clerics teach some courses
                and celebrate (voluntary) mass every day. In addition, the University Ministry hosts
                other religious services and leads programs to teach students about other faiths. The
                highly selective honors program includes interdisciplinary courses and a senior
                thesis. Twenty-four percent of students participate in study abroad programs that
                take them to more than 30 countries around the world, including India, Ireland,
                Peru, and Switzerland.
                <br><br>Seventy-five percent of DePaul undergraduates hail from Illinois, and less than 1
                percent come from foreign countries. Hispanics represent 19 percent of the student
                body, African Americans 8 percent, Asian Americans 10 percent, and multiracial
                students 4 percent. Twenty-nine percent of incoming freshmen are eligible for Pell
                Grants. “The students at DePaul are very diverse,” says a sophomore. “There are
                student organizations to represent all different faiths, ethnicities, and backgrounds.”
                <br><br>DePaul has a
                reputation for being politically liberal, and “it has become more liberal
                in recent years,” says a junior. In addition to academic merit scholarships, DePaul
                also awards scholarships to students who have artistic talent or strong leadership
                skills or those who participate in community service; such awards average $13,000
                per year. Scholarships for athletes are available too.
                <br><br>One student complains, “Weekends can be boring because many students go
                home.” Traditionally, DePaul has been a commuter school, and just 18 percent of
                undergraduates live in university housing. Students find the dorms comfortable and
                well maintained, but they advise applying early to secure a bed, especially after
                sophomore year. “Housing is in high demand around here,” says a junior. The
                Lincoln Park campus includes six modern co-ed dorms and six townhouse and
                apartment buildings. At the Loop campus, a 1,700-student residence hall includes a
                rooftop garden, fitness center, and music, art, and study rooms. Although students
                like campus housing, some find the food overpriced
                and limited. “I’m a vegan, and there is not a large or
                good variety,” says a junior. While Chicago may have
                a high-crime reputation, students say campus security is visible, with officers patrolling in cars and
                on foot, and
                dorms require students to swipe ID cards at two or three
                places before allowing entrance.
                <br><br>Fraternities and sororities draw just 5 percent of DePaul men and 11 percent of
                the women, respectively. Not surprisingly, with the school’s proximity to Chicago’s
                concert venues, restaurants, bars, clubs (especially on Rush Street), and sporting
                events, most social life occurs off campus. A music major says of the city, “There is
                everything to do here.” In the warmer months, the beaches of Lake Michigan beckon
                students, while the university’s huge annual outdoor Fest concert attracts large
                crowds from both campuses. Students say that enforcement of alcohol policies
                doesn’t always work when it comes to underage drinking.
                <br><br>DePaul is a member of the Big East Conference, and the Blue Demons compete in Division I in 15
                sports.
                Men’s basketball
                is the headline story, beginning
                with the Midnight Madness of each fall’s first practice in October. The game against
                Notre Dame always draws a capacity crowd, though Loyola is DePaul’s oldest rival.
                Men’s track and field and women’s basketball, tennis, and softball have won Big East
                championships recently. Intramurals and club sports are big draws, and the Campus
                Recreation department offers a 123,000-square-foot fitness and recreation facility,
                which includes a four-court gymnasium, a pool, a 200-meter track, and more.
                <br><br>Expanding academic programs, a diverse student body, and all the opportunity of the city of
                Chicago make
                DePaul a
                dynamic university, but students say its
                popularity is due as much to the special bonds they feel with fellow Blue Demons.
                “DePaul University provides students a unique atmosphere in which to learn and
                grow,” says a sophomore. “The campus and its students are friendly, open, and
                always inviting.”

                        Forget about cheerleaders, homecoming games, and other traditional trappings of

                        job. Academic focus is on engineering with a bit of architecture thrown in for good
                        measure. If your goal is a technical job in the Chicago area, this is your place. Though
                        private, IIT is relatively inexpensive.

                Engineers unite at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where classwork and realworld experience
                promise to propel
                students to the top of their fields. After all, when
                you’re engaged in comprehensive undergraduate research and able to take advantage of state-of-the-art
                labs, you’re
                nearly guaranteed a high-paying job after graduation. IIT programs may be hard, says a junior, but the
                work “will pay
                off in the end”
                as students enter the workforce. Indeed, kids here tend to burn the midnight oil, but
                frequently escape to downtown Chicago for culture and much-deserved fun.
                <br><br>IIT’s home is an urban, 120-acre campus designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,
                the influential 20th-century architect who directed the architecture school for 20
                years. Founded in 1890, the school is just three miles south of Chicago’s Loop, and
                one mile west of Lake Michigan. Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the White Sox,
                is located directly across from the campus. Miesian-style buildings are adorned by
                trees and grassy open parks. Crown Hall, home of IIT’s College of Architecture, is a
                National Historic Landmark.
                <br><br>Along with humanities and social science courses, students must fulfill general
                education requirements that include mathematics, computer science, natural science, and engineering;
                writing is
                emphasized across the curriculum. All freshmen
                take an introduction to the professions seminar, which includes discussion of innovation, ethics,
                teamwork,
                communication,
                and leadership. Incoming first-years also receive Apple iPads; students work with
                professors to create new applications in order to “enhance their educational experience.”
                Multidisciplinary, group-based
                learning is big at IIT. Every student must complete two semester-long interprofession projects that
                sharpen real-world
                skills.
                <br><br>Engineering is the most popular major, and it sets the tone at IIT. Every
                engineering department is outstanding. Architecture is also popular and highly
                regarded; the curriculum emphasizes a team approach that mixes third- through
                fifth-year students under the supervision of a master professor. “Architecture has
                a strong faculty,” says one student, “and biomedical engineering is very new and
                well funded.” Computer science and business round out the most popular majors,
                and the sciences, physics in particular, are first-rate. Guided by an academic reorganization, the
                physical sciences
                have been bolstered, grouped together with
                career-oriented fields such as psychology and computer information systems. IIT
                is the first university to offer a B.S. in bioanalytical chemistry, and recently added
                majors include environmental chemistry, forensic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Dual admissions
                programs are available in pharmacy, optometry, and
                osteopathic medicine.
                <br><br>IIT’s academic climate is pretty unforgiving, students say. Both the workload
                and the competition are fierce. “The courses are very difficult,” says a junior. Half
                of the classes have fewer than 20 students, and professors always teach their own
                classes, while teaching assistants are available for labs and extra help. “Professors
                take an active role in their students’ education,” states a biochemistry major.
                <br><br>In addition to meeting outside of class to go over problem sets or for career
                direction, IIT students and professors often work side by side on research projects.
                The College of Science awards several $5,000 scholarships to undergrads to perform
                research work under the supervision of faculty during the summer. Engineering students make use of
                sophisticated labs
                and have access to independent research labs in
                Chicago. Two dozen on-campus research centers, such as the Pritzker Institute of
                Biomedical Science and Engineering and the Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy
                Research, provide additional opportunities. The five-year co-op program—another
                possibility for hands-on experience—helps lead IIT students into high-paying jobs
                after graduation. Study abroad programs send students to more than 50 nations
                around the globe, including France, Greece, Chile, and Singapore; 10 percent of IIT
                students—mostly architecture majors—participate.
                <br><br>“Students at IIT are nerds,” reports a communication major, but “in a good
                way.” In-state students account for 53 percent of the undergraduate population,
                and a sizable 21 percent hail from foreign countries. African Americans constitute
                6 percent of the student body, Hispanics 16 percent, Asian Americans 14 percent,
                and multiracial students 3 percent. Students say International Fest is one of the
                year’s most popular events, and IIT sponsors a multitude of cultural awareness workshops and events on
                different
                diversity-related topics. Merit scholarships averaging
                $24,800 are available, and 29 percent of incoming students are Pell-eligible.
                <br><br>As befits the school’s urban location, a large chunk of students commute. The
                39 percent of students who live in residence halls report that rooms are nice but can
                be difficult to get. The McCormick Student
                Village is popular, and students note that Fowler
                has the biggest rooms but is the only dorm
                without air-conditioning. The Women in Social
                Engagement learning community attracts
                female students who are interested in leadership, civic engagement, and social
                change. Some students live in apartments in the area; others inhabit one of the eight
                fraternity houses. The dining hall has several meal plans and a special vegetarian
                menu. Engineers and architects—notorious late-night studiers—have to hit the
                library early, since it closes at 10 p.m.
                <br><br>IIT’s six-block campus is contiguous to Chicago’s “Gap” community, where historic but rundown
                homes are
                being
                rehabilitated to form one of the city’s hottest
                new urban residential areas. Most students love exploring Chicago; the city skyline
                is beautiful and a veritable museum, with buildings designed by the likes of Frank
                Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, and, of course, Mies van der Rohe. “Chicago provides
                educational opportunities, internship opportunities, and countless things to do,”
                says one biomedical engineering major. Lake Michigan is within jogging distance,
                Chinatown is a walk away for lunch or dinner, and the school provides free shuttle
                bus service to downtown on weekends.
                <br><br>Although students who stick around campus on weekends must work hard to
                find social events, “The social life at IIT has improved over my four years,” says a
                senior. Fraternities claim 10 percent of the men and sororities attract 13 percent
                of the women, and many students say the social aspect of Greek life is a welcome
                addition to campus. The Union Board offers movies, concerts, and comedians, and the Bog brings in bands
                on Thursdays and Saturdays. The annual boat cruise and
                casino night on the Odyssey sightseeing boat is a favorite event, and students can
                also take advantage of the city’s ample nightlife or plan outings to museums or the
                Chicago Symphony.
                <br><br>In sports-crazy Chicago, IIT’s Division III athletic teams (the Scarlet Hawks) are
                not much of a draw. Still, students praise the men’s baseball and basketball teams,
                and men’s and women’s soccer and women’s volleyball are competitive. Twelve recreational sports, ranging
                from water polo
                to Quidditch, are available, but students
                lament the fact that the facilities close at 5 p.m. on weekends.
                <br><br>Shipping off to Chi-town to take on the mammoth workload at IIT means hitting the books for
                hours upon hours and a fair
                share of all-nighters. But the payoff is
                undeniable. One student says bluntly, “This school is for people who want to make
                a lot of money after college.” Indeed, students who take advantage of this small
                school’s ever-improving engineering departments are likely to have their pick of
                careers after graduation. And with the innumerable diversions offered in the Windy
                City, students at IIT revel in the best of two worlds: a challenging academic climate
                and a great city in which to let off all that steam.

            <p><strong><i>
                        IWU is a small Midwestern university with a penchant for creativity and the spirit of
                        inquiry. The curriculum is basic liberal arts with additional divisions devoted to fine arts
                        and nursing. An optional three-week term in May allows students to travel or explore
                        an interest. IWU’s reputation is limited outside Illinois and surrounding states.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Illinois Wesleyan University has its sights set on a special breed of student—the
                kind who isn’t afraid to be many things at once. Students here are encouraged to
                pursue diverse passions, and IWU is a mecca for students who have preprofessional
                interests, especially those with unusual pairings like management and music. “What
                makes Wesleyan really stand out is its care and attention for each student as an individual,” says a
                junior.
                <br><br>Founded in 1850, IWU occupies an 80-acre campus site in a north-side residential district of
                Bloomington. The heart of
                campus is the central quadrangle, and
                tree-lined walkways connect buildings that range in style from gray stone Gothic
                to ultramodern steel and glass. IWU’s main classroom building, State Farm Hall,
                includes state-of-the-art classrooms and research spaces. A recent expansion of the
                Shirk Center doubled the size of the university’s fitness facilities.
                <br><br>Illinois Wesleyan’s general education requirements expose students to a broad
                array of liberal arts disciplines and are intended to help them develop critical-thinking
                and writing skills, imagination, intellectual independence, social awareness, and
                sensitivity to others. All first-year students must take a Gateway Colloquium, a topicbased,
                seminar-style class of 15
                that stresses critical reading, writing, discussion, and
                analytical skills. Recent topics include What Is Justice?, The Mathematics of Online Security and
                Privacy, and Embracing Your Undecidedness. First-years also attend the
                university’s weeklong Turning Titan orientation program, which involves an opening convocation, a common
                reading
                program, a day of community service, the Titan
                Carnival, and other events.
                <br><br>Among the top-notch programs in the College of Liberal Arts are biology, English,
                chemistry, and math, and some of the most popular majors include business administration, accounting,
                and psychology.
                The business administration department offers
                a Portfolio Management course, in which students buy and sell orders overseen by a
                client board composed of university trustees. In the design, technology, and entrepreneurship major,
                students practice
                all
                phases of successfully conceiving, developing, and bringing a product to market; administrators say the
                program aims to
                turn
                out “creative people who can actually implement their ideas.” IWU’s School of
                Nursing is another big draw. The College of Fine Arts houses three separate schools
                of music, art, and drama; music is the standout, offering 10 distinct majors and
                boasting such talented alumni as opera star Dawn Upshaw.
                <br><br>“The academic climate is challenging but rewarding,” says a senior. “It forces
                you to develop independent critical-thinking skills.” Seventy-one percent of courses
                have fewer than 20 students, and professors are “passionate about their subjects,
                friendly, and approachable,” a senior says. In addition to the usual fall and spring
                semesters, IWU has an optional three-week May term that gives students a chance
                to focus on a single intensive course, or to conduct a research or service project or
                an internship. Faculty-led May term travel courses are a particularly popular option.
                Overall, half of the students take advantage of the university’s study abroad program, which sends them
                packing to more
                than 70 countries, including England,
                Denmark, and Japan. Research opportunities are also plentiful, with 60 percent of
                students taking part, and IWU hosts an annual student research conference that
                attracts scholars from all disciplines.
                <br><br>Undergraduates at IWU are largely the homegrown variety, with 81 percent
                hailing from Illinois and 5 percent from outside the country. Students describe their
                classmates as “down-to-earth” and “easy to talk
                to.” Although IWU began admitting African
                American students in 1867, they still account for
                only 5 percent of the student body. Hispanics represent 8 percent, Asian Americans 6 percent, and
                multiracial students 2 percent. Students here are
                generally liberal, socially conscious, and active in groups like Circle K, the Alpha Phi
                Omega service fraternity, and Habitat for Humanity. Merit scholarships averaging
                $19,200 are available to qualified students; there are no athletic scholarships.
                Twenty-five percent of freshmen are Pell-eligible.
                <br><br>Housing is guaranteed for four years, and 79 percent of students live in the
                dorms. “Other schools have better dorms,” says one student, “but after freshman
                year, housing gets a lot better.” Students must be at least 21 to live off campus.
                Campus food is described as tasty but not as diverse as it could be. Most students say
                campus security is good, and the university’s Consent Is Sexy campaign is helping
                push awareness of and discussions about sexual violence on campus.
                <br><br>Thirty-two percent of the men and 34 percent of the women go Greek, and
                fraternities and sororities are the focus of IWU’s social life. “Most parties occur at
                frat houses, but the campus is so small that they are open to everyone,” explains an
                accounting major. Students admit that alcohol policies, which allow drinking on
                campus for those of legal age, don’t always stop underage drinkers. For alternatives,
                the Office of Student Activities sponsors free events in the student center almost every weekend, and
                academic departments and the Student Senate regularly bring
                guest speakers to campus. Each fall during homecoming, Greeks and dorm dwellers
                compete in the Titan Games to get appropriately psyched.
                <br><br>Thanks to the proximity of Illinois State University—less than a mile away in
                neighboring Normal—IWU offers more than the typical small college town atmosphere. The area’s total
                student population
                of about 25,000 provides students at tiny
                IWU with “the best of both worlds,” says a senior. “Some kids from big cities say
                there is nothing to do in Bloomington-Normal, but in my opinion, they are exaggerating,” says a
                freshman. “There may not
                constantly be ten different events to
                choose from at any given time, but there is always something.” The best road trips
                are to Peoria or Urbana–Champaign (home of the University of Illinois) or to Chicago
                or St. Louis, each two and a half hours away.
                <br><br>The IWU Titans compete in the Division III College Conference of Illinois and
                Wisconsin. Baseball and football are well and good, but Titans basketball really gets
                students going. The women’s track and field team is a recent national champion,
                and men’s and women’s basketball, men’s golf and baseball, and women’s soccer
                and softball are also strong. The Fort Natatorium houses an impressive 14-lane
                swimming pool, and the swim team has had its share of stars. The small but active
                recreational sports program offers about 15 club and intramural sports.
                <br><br>One of the Midwest’s better-kept secrets, Illinois Wesleyan is at once cozy and
                diverse, loaded with opportunities for ambitious students with traditional or offbeat
                interests. As one junior advises, “The school provides a multitude of paths down
                which one can travel, and it is up to the student to decide which path to take. IWU
                allows you to become who you want to be, but only if you let it.”

                <h3><u>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</u></h3>
            </div>
            <p><strong><i>
                        Half a step behind Michigan and neck and neck with Wisconsin among top Midwestern
                        public universities. U of I’s strengths include business, communication, engineering,
                        architecture, and the natural sciences. Three-quarters of the undergraduates hail
                        from in state. Huge Greek system.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Like many of its Midwestern neighbors, the University of Illinois has its roots in
                agriculture. The Morrow Plots, the oldest experimental fields in the nation, still
                rest in the middle of campus—and when the wind blows the wrong way, students
                are not-so-subtly reminded of their heritage as a farm school. Like most big, public
                universities, U of I has a barn full of choices, and with a strong Greek system and 1,200 clubs, social
                activities are more than plentiful. Homecoming weekend was
                invented at the University of Illinois, and whether cheering for the Illini, pledging a Greek
                organization, or
                celebrating Moms’, Dads’, or Siblings’ Weekends,
                students here stir up a vibrant mix of school spirit and good times. This may
                look and feel like a laid-back Midwestern campus, but make no mistake: Illinois’s
                stellar academics and learning communities are on par with any of the country’s
                public flagships.
                <br><br>Befitting the oldest land grant institution, the Illinois campus was built in farm
                country between the twin cities of Champaign and Urbana. The parklike campus
                was designed along a mile-long axis where trees and walkways separate stately
                white-columned Georgian structures made of brick. Physically challenged students
                tend to appreciate the campus because it is flat and well equipped with ramps and
                widened doorways. The impressive Illinois library system, the largest public university collection of
                its kind
                worldwide, makes it easier to keep up with classwork. A
                225,000-square-foot computer science center and the physical education center are
                notable. New construction includes the $25 million Siebel Center for Design, opening in 2020.
                <br><br>Illinois has eight undergraduate colleges and one school that together offer
                more than 150 undergraduate programs; if nothing strikes your fancy, you may
                design your own. The general education program includes standard distribution requirements across a
                range of subjects;
                students may
                fulfill some requirements by taking recently launched Grand Challenge Learning
                courses, interdisciplinary classes that explore three main “pathways,” or real-world
                challenges facing today’s society: Inequality and Cultural Understanding; Health
                and Wellness; and Sustainability, Energy, and the Environment.
                <br><br>Partially because of its size, Illinois can afford to support excellent programs
                across the university, including the expansion of undergraduate minors campuswide. Engineering,
                business, communication,
                social sciences, architecture, education, industrial design, and the sciences—especially agriculture and
                veterinary
                medicine—get high marks from students and lots of resources from administrators. A new “CS + X” degree
                program allows
                students to combine the study of
                computer science with one of 10 other liberal arts fields, ranging from anthropology and advertising to
                chemistry and
                crop sciences, without having to go so far as
                double majoring. The initiative is a way for students to demonstrate both technical competence and
                career-related
                expertise to future employers. The interdisciplinary Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and
                Technology offers
                opportunities for undergraduate research in areas like intelligent systems and
                molecular science and engineering.
                <br><br>“Overall, classes are demanding,” says a senior. Freshmen and sophomores, who
                register last, may have trouble getting into necessary courses, but professors and
                academic advisors can usually help if classes you need are full, and students appreciate their
                dedication. Illinois has
                its share of stellar faculty, including Nobel laureates, National Medal of Science winners, and dozens
                of members of the
                National
                Academy of Sciences. “The quality of teaching is high with few exceptions,” says
                a psychology major. “They are truly invested in our success,” adds a senior. Even
                freshmen stuck in large lectures (750 seats) will find some personal attention in
                the associated discussion sections, led by graduate teaching assistants. Freshman
                Discovery Courses, seminars limited to 19 students, enable first-year students to
                interact closely with full professors. The honors program includes faculty mentoring, intensive
                seminars, advanced
                sections of regular courses, and access to special
                resources. About 7 percent of undergraduates travel and study abroad each year,
                roaming 45 countries around the globe.
                <br><br>Seventy-three percent of Illinois undergrads are homegrown and “the school
                is continuously getting more diverse,” a sophomore says. Since Illinois stretches
                from the wealthy north suburbs of sophisticated Chicago to the unspoiled rural hills
                bordering Kentucky and encompasses classic farm towns as well as factory towns,
                students do come from multiple backgrounds and fit less into the stereotypical
                “Midwest” mold than one might think. African Americans make up 6 percent of the
                student body, Hispanics 11 percent, Asian Americans 18 percent, and multiracial
                students 3 percent, while international students account for 17 percent. Merit scholarships averaging
                $5,400 and roughly
                200 athletic awards are doled out annually; 22
                percent of freshmen receive Pell Grants. The Illinois Commitment program provides
                free tuition and fees for four years for qualified in-state freshmen or transfer students
                whose family income is $61,000 or less.
                <br><br>Half of all undergrads live in U of I’s co-ed and single-sex residence halls, which
                range in size from 51 to 660 beds and are arranged in quadrangle-like groups. Some
                dorms are quite a hike from classrooms, veterans warn. The university offers 11
                themed living/learning communities, such as WIMSE (Women in Math, Science,
                and Engineering) and Innovation LLC (entrepreneurship and creativity), that combine in-hall courses with
                specialized
                cocurricular activities. Each residence hall is a
                mini-neighborhood, with dining halls, darkrooms, libraries, music practice rooms,
                computers, and lounges creating a sense of community. Chefs keep the food interesting, and campus
                security maintains a
                visible presence.
                <br><br>Illinois claims to have the largest Greek system anywhere, with nearly 100 chapters drawing 21
                percent of the men and 27
                percent of the women. Illinois attracts
                many socially oriented students who love parties and intramural sports, which may
                be why the Greek influence is particularly strong. Independents don’t have to suffer
                boredom, though, as there are also nearly 1,200
                registered student clubs and organizations,
                ranging from the ice hockey team to ethnic
                advocacy groups. “It is a big campus that likes
                to have a lot of fun,” a student says. Though drinking is prohibited in the dorms, the
                campus policies regarding alcohol are a “token gesture,” a business major says. On
                most weekends, the Illini Union showcases bands, comedians, and hypnotists in its
                central café. The impressive Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, with four theaters and more than
                350 annual
                performances, serves as the area’s cultural center,
                while Assembly Hall hosts national touring acts. Students get a discount at both
                facilities. For those who itch for the stimulation of a big city, the campus is just
                about equidistant from Chicago, Indianapolis, and St. Louis, and Mardi Gras makes
                for a good road trip in the dead of winter.
                <br><br>The Division I Illini compete in the Big Ten, and men’s basketball and baseball
                have winning traditions. Men’s golf, gymnastics, and tennis are recent conference
                champs, and women’s gymnastics, tennis, and softball are solid too. The intramural
                program is extensive, with available facilities that include 16 full-length basketball
                courts, five pools, 19 handball/racquetball courts, a skating rink, a baseball stadium, and the $5.1
                million Atkins
                Tennis Center. Eighty-five percent of the student
                body participates in recreational sports. Illinois has a strong athletic program for
                students with disabilities, including wheelchair basketball, which was invented at
                the university.
                <br><br>While the University of Illinois may seem mammoth to some students, don’t be
                scared off by this giant institution. Academic and social opportunities are incredibly
                diverse, and classroom sizes, while growing, are supplemented by smaller group discussions. The breadth
                of the programs
                offered combined with an active campus life
                makes for a well-rounded college experience, students say. “We have a great reputation, and it only
                grows stronger and
                stronger.”

                        Most people don’t realize that MSU is the largest institution of higher education
                        in Michigan. Students can find a niche in strong preprofessional programs such
                        as hospitality business management, prevet, and education. MSU’s self-contained
                        campus is like a town unto itself, with a bus system available to get from one side to
                        the other. Sexual abuse scandal continues to generate headlines.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Michigan State’s roots are agricultural—the school became the state’s land grant
                institution in 1862—and future farmers, plant scientists, and veterinarians still
                flourish here. So do those with wanderlust, thanks to study abroad programs on
                each of the world’s seven continents. MSU’s programs in natural sciences and multidisciplinary social
                sciences offer
                students the feel of a small, liberal arts college and
                the resources of a large research university. “Resources here abound,” says a senior.
                <br><br>The heart of the MSU campus, north of the Red Cedar River, boasts ivy-covered
                brick buildings, some of which predate the Civil War and are listed on the National
                Register of Historic Places. This area houses five colleges plus the MSU Union and
                10 residence halls. Across the river are the medical complex, newer dorms, and two
                18-hole golf courses. Most notably, MSU is home to the National Superconducting
                Cyclotron Laboratory. Current construction includes the $730 million Facility for
                Rare Isotope Beams, a new facility for nuclear science research that is funded in partnership with the
                U.S. Department
                of Energy and the state of Michigan and expected
                to be completed in 2022. On the southernmost part of campus are farms and animal
                research and teaching facilities.
                <br><br>Michigan State students tend to be preprofessional and clear about their interests; the premed,
                prevet,
                and teacher
                education programs are strong, and the most
                popular majors include marketing, communication, journalism, various fields in the
                social sciences, and biological sciences. Other popular options include supply chain management,
                environmental science, and hospitality business
                management; students in the latter program get
                real-world experience by staffing the university’s hotel and conference center. To
                graduate, all students must satisfy university requirements in math and writing,
                complete a major, and take a minimum of 26 credits in the integrative studies program, which includes
                arts and
                humanities; social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and biological and physical sciences.
                <br><br>Academics at MSU get tougher as students advance through their majors,
                according to a junior. “Many of our courses are very competitive because they play a
                part in determining whether or not you are accepted into a specific program,” notes
                a classmate. Classes are often quite large, with 24 percent enrolling more than 50
                students, but students say that, for the most part, professors are accessible and dedicated. Hundreds of
                group-based and
                individual research opportunities are available
                to undergraduates. The Honors College offers the intimacy of a small-college atmosphere. MSU has a
                strong international
                component as well, with more than 275
                study abroad programs in nearly 60 countries; 23 percent of undergrads take part.
                <br><br>“Students here are friendly and diverse,” says an elementary education major.
                “We also have a large international population, which is really cool because it gives
                you the opportunity to get to know people and cultures from all over the world.”
                Seventy-five percent of undergraduates are Michigan residents, and 12 percent are
                international. Whether they come from gritty Motor City or pretty Traverse City, or
                from somewhere outside the Midwest, Michigan State students care about the world
                around them. Indeed, more than 2,700 alumni have served in the Peace Corps since
                the school first partnered with the agency in 1961, a milestone reached by only four
                other universities. African Americans make up 7 percent of the student body, Asian
                Americans add 5 percent, Hispanics constitute 4 percent, and multiracial students
                represent 3 percent. Scholarships are offered in 25 Division I sports, and thousands
                of students also receive grants and awards based on academic merit, which average
                $10,500 annually.
                <br><br>Forty percent of MSU students—including nearly all freshmen—live in Michigan
                State’s residence halls and apartment communities, which one sophomore describes
                as “very convenient and well maintained.” Those seeking a traditional college experience can bunk in one
                of five huge “neighborhoods,” each with three to 10
                residence halls plus libraries, advising and tutoring services, health services, cafeterias, and
                recreation areas. Other
                living/learning programs, known by their catchy
                acronyms, include RISE (focus on the environment), MRULE (multiracial unity), and
                CORE (engineering). All 27 of the school’s residence halls are to be updated by 2020.
                MSU’s dining services dish out meals at nine dining halls, two food courts, and one
                food truck. “All the food is edible,” says a senior.
                <br><br>Campus safety measures include walking escorts for those who stay late at the
                library, and Lansing’s bus system offers discounted night-owl rates for those living
                farther away. Parking places on campus are in chronically short supply, and students complain about the
                tickets they
                receive as a result. Once they’ve earned 28
                credits, students may move off campus. Many do so because the city of East
                Lansing, just outside Michigan’s capital, offers all the positive aspects of a large
                urban area (the population more than doubles when school is in session), along
                with the safety and community feel of a much smaller town. According to one
                student, “The social life at MSU is very lively on the weekends.” Twelve percent of
                MSU men and 11 percent of the women go Greek. Other weekend alternatives
                include bands, dances, and comedians brought in by the Student Activities Board
                and events held by the more than 900 student organizations. Second-run movies
                are also shown in Wells Hall—free for campus dwellers, and a couple of bucks for
                those who live off campus.
                <br><br>Weekends are dominated by Big Ten athletic competitions, with the MSU–
                Michigan rivalry especially fierce. “Our large campus is filled from end to end with
                individuals sporting green and white;
                alcohol-free tailgating is also available,”
                says a junior. “Seeing 150,000 people in a
                space that usually has about 60,000 is quite
                an experience.” The football, men’s basketball, and women’s golf teams are recent
                conference champions. After more than six decades of standing guard at Kalamazoo
                Street and Red Cedar Road, the school’s mascot, affectionately known as “Sparty,”
                was moved indoors to protect him from the elements. However, a replica stands
                outside and is guarded by students when Wolverines come to town. Students are still
                able to paint “the Rock,” a large boulder donated in the 1960s, to advertise campus
                events, birthdays, anniversaries, and the like. Eighteen intramurals and 23 club
                sports, from “spartyball” (a variation of indoor soccer) to competitive cheer, also
                keep students busy.
                <br><br>MSU is struggling to deal with continuing fallout from a scandal that erupted
                in 2017 involving a former faculty member and physician to athletes who was convicted of abusing scores
                of girls and
                young women over many years. The scandal
                attracted national attention and, among other things, led to the resignation of the
                university president. Administrators say they are working hard to strengthen policies, procedures,
                training, and
                community resources to ensure that MSU continues
                to be a safe, cosmopolitan campus where future leaders, physicians, and financiers
                happily coexist in what one student calls a “diverse, friendly, and expressive” bunch.

                        The biggest school in the Big Ten, Ohio State lacks the prestige of a Michigan or
                        a Wisconsin, in part because it competes with two other Ohio publics, Miami and
                        Ohio U, for top students. Operates the mother of all college sports programs that
                        consistently claims multiple national titles. Check out the top-notch honors program.
                        Columbus is a major city and the capital of Ohio
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                Envision a campus with 52,000 students and too many opportunities to count.
                What might come to mind is Ohio State University, located in the heart of the
                state’s capital, offering 15 colleges and 12,000 courses in more than 200 undergraduate majors. If those
                numbers aren’t
                staggering enough, consider the fact that OSU
                has 36 varsity sports, 30 intramural sports, nearly 60 sports clubs, and the third largest campus in the
                nation. It also
                has an operating budget larger than that of the state
                of Delaware. While students cite the school’s size as both a blessing and a curse, all
                seem to agree that at OSU, the sky is the limit for those with a desire to sample its
                academic and other resources.
                <br><br>This megauniversity stands on 1,777 acres in the middle of the city, just two
                miles north of downtown Columbus. Across the Olentangy River from campus is a
                teaching and research farm associated with the College of Food, Agricultural, and
                Environmental Sciences. “One part of the campus
                maintains a nostalgic air while another is relatively
                modern,” observes a student. The grounds are nicely
                landscaped, and a centrally located lake provides a
                peaceful setting for contemplation and a break from all the surrounding activity.
                OSU’s rich array of academic resources includes 15 libraries, all linked electronically,
                with seven million volumes. The Recreation and Physical Activity Center (RPAC) is
                the nation’s largest facility dedicated to student fitness, wellness, and recreation.
                Since 2016, eight new residence halls, a dining hall, and a recreation facility have
                been added to the campus’s North district.
                <br><br>The university’s commitment to liberal arts learning means all undergrads must
                satisfy rigorous general education requirements that include courses in math, writing,
                foreign language, social science, natural science, and arts and humanities. Some of
                the school’s most celebrated departments include business, engineering, neuroscience,
                dance, and design; political science and education are also strong. OSU bills itself as the
                place to go for computer graphics and has a supercomputer center to back up its claim.
                The strong African American and African studies program, which grew out of the civil
                rights movement of the 1960s, offers the most extensive offering of African languages
                of any U.S. university. Furthermore, the university has the nation’s only programs in
                welding engineering and geodetic science, the state’s only program in medical communications, and the
                nation’s first
                undergraduate program in data analytics. The majors
                that enroll the most students include psychology, finance, communication, and biology. A personalized
                study program
                enables students to create their own majors.
                <br><br>Freshmen may take advantage of numerous first-year programs, including the
                First Year Success Series covering topics like study skills and career exploration, and
                pre-enrollment programs like the Leadership Collaborative and Buckeyes First (for
                first-generation students). Once the academic year is underway, they experience
                a variety of class formats and sizes, ranging from intimate freshman seminars to
                large lectures; 22 percent of all undergraduate classes have more than 50 students.
                Teaching assistants hold smaller recitation sections of large lecture courses and deal
                on a personal level with students. Class sizes generally whittle down as students continue in their
                fields of study. At
                such a large institution, the quality of instruction
                can vary greatly, and students report this to be the case. But, according to a welding
                engineering major, “Students are generally willing to work together and help each
                other in courses that they share.”
                <br><br>OSU’s honors program allows selected students to learn from top professors in
                small classes averaging about 25 students each. “The whole system of honors
                classes, priority scheduling, honors housing, and cocurricular activities really adds
                to the overall experience at OSU,” a biology major says. Twenty percent of undergraduates participate in
                research
                opportunities
                coordinated by the Office of Undergraduate
                Research and Creative Inquiry. Columbus affords
                students access to internships with the state government, Fortune 500 companies, and major
                tech and research organizations, including the IBM Analytics Solutions Lab and
                Battelle. Roughly 5 percent of students study abroad through 200 programs in more
                than 70 countries.
                <br><br>“Most students are extremely well-mannered, ambitious, open-minded, and
                obsessed with the Buckeyes,” says a loyal sophomore. Seventy-five percent of Ohio
                State’s undergraduates come from Ohio, and most out-of-staters come largely from
                Illinois, Pennsylvania, California, New York, and New Jersey—many of them lured
                by one of the most generous merit aid programs of any public university in the
                country. Eight percent come from foreign countries. The student body is 6 percent
                African American, 4 percent Hispanic, 7 percent Asian American, and 3 percent
                multiracial. Several programs aim to attract and retain minority students, including
                a statewide Young Scholars Program that begins working with students when they
                start the seventh grade. Qualified students compete for merit scholarships averaging $7,200, and
                hundreds of athletic
                scholarships go to talented athletes each year.
                For incoming, in-state freshmen, the Ohio State Tuition Guarantee freezes tuition,
                fees, and room and board for four years.
                <br><br>The residence halls, which house 32 percent of the Ohio State masses, are located
                in three areas: North, South, and Olentangy (that is, those closest to the Olentangy
                River). Freshmen and sophomores are required to live in residence halls unless they
                are commuting from home, and freshmen are scattered among each of OSU’s 42
                residence halls. “The accommodations are adequate and sometimes excellent,
                depending on the age of the building,” says a
                junior. The South campus section is said to be
                among the most desirable (it’s more sociable, louder, and full of single rooms). A
                system of variable room rates based on frills (air-conditioning, private bath, number
                of roommates), as well as a choice of four meal-plan options, give students flexibility
                in determining their housing costs. “The food at OSU is fantastic,” chirps one student. Buckeyes ACT is
                a comprehensive
                program intended to combat sexual misconduct and relationship violence on campus.
                <br><br>OSU is a bustling place on weekends. “Social life is never-ending,” cheers one
                student. Various social events are planned by on-campus housing groups—floors,
                dorms, or sections of the campus. The student union runs eateries, a tavern, movies, and other
                activities. Thirteen percent of OSU men and 14 percent of the women
                go Greek. By one account, these students make the Greek system “a way of life and
                isolate themselves from the rest of the student population.” But with nearly 1,400
                other student organizations to choose from, it’s hardly difficult for those not interested in the Greek
                scene to find
                something to get involved with.
                <br><br>Such a large student market has, of course, produced a strip of bars, fast-food
                joints, convenience stores, bookstores, vegetarian restaurants, and you-name-its
                along the edge of the campus on High Street, and downtown Columbus is just a few
                minutes away. “Columbus is a vibrant town,” says a junior. The fine public transportation system carries
                students not
                only throughout this capital city but also around
                the sprawling campus. In addition to the usual shopping centers, restaurants, golf
                courses, and movie theaters, Columbus boasts a symphony orchestra, a ballet, and
                professional hockey and soccer teams; OSU’s D-Tix program offers students discounted or free tickets to
                cultural and
                sporting events. The city’s central location in
                the state makes it easily accessible to Cleveland and Cincinnati. Outdoor enthusiasts
                can ski in nearby Mansfield, canoe and sail on the Olentangy and Scioto rivers, hike
                the city’s 19 metro parks, or camp in nearby Hocking Hills.
                <br><br>Ohio State operates perhaps the most lavish—and successful—college sports
                program in the nation. The Buckeyes field 16 men’s, 17 women’s, and three co-ed
                varsity teams, from golf to gymnastics to riflery. (A buckeye, incidentally, is a small,
                shiny nut that falls from Ohio’s official state tree.) Recent national champions
                include women’s synchronized swimming, men’s volleyball, and men’s pistol, and
                the school has claimed 18 conference championships in the last two years. “Football
                is somewhat like religion,” says one student. “As hard as students may work during
                the school week, everything stops on game day.” Rivalries abound, and nonrecruited
                students should not expect to make any varsity team as walk-ons. Many take advantage of an ambitious
                intramural program
                that boasts a dozen basketball courts and
                26 courts for handball, squash, and racquetball.
                <br><br>OSU’s sheer size is sometimes overwhelming to be sure, but students here
                seem to thrive on the challenge and excitement of a big university, not to mention
                Buckeye spirit. For those who really want to be Buckeyes, be prepared to jump in
                with both feet and be assertive about your goals. “Knowing what you want is great,
                but to get it, you’ll need to work hard,” warns one student. “Because if you want it,
                there are likely hundreds of other people who want it too.”

            </div>
            <p><strong><i>
                        Madison draws a third of its students from out of state, a higher proportion than
                        some other leading Midwestern public universities. Why brave the cold? Reasons
                        include top programs in an array of professional fields and several innovative living/
                        learning programs. There’s also the pleasure of life in Madison, a combination state
                        capital/college town in the mold of Austin, Texas. Sky-high retention rates.
                    </i></strong></p>
            <p>
                For more than a century, the University of Wisconsin has been guided by the
                Progressive-era philosophy of the “Wisconsin Idea” that the purpose of a great state
                university is to seek truth and apply the resulting knowledge to the benefit of the
                students and society as a whole. Such a philosophy has turned Wisconsin into one
                of the world’s leading universities—one where nearly 30,000 undergraduates take
                advantage of high-level academics and a rich array of resources. After five years of deep budget cuts
                enacted by the former governor and other state leaders with little
                sympathy for the Wisconsin Idea, state funding is back on the rise, and Wisconsin
                remains a place where professional and other programs are outstanding. Just bring a
                strong desire to learn—and a very warm coat.
                <br><br>Described by one Madison student as “architecturally olden with a modern
                touch,” the mainly brick campus is distinctive. It spreads out over 936 hilly, treecovered acres and
                across an isthmus
                between two glacial lakes, Mendota and
                Monona, named by Native Americans who once lived along their shores. From atop
                Bascom Hill, the center of campus, you look east past the statue of Lincoln and the
                liberal arts buildings, down to a library mall that was the scene of many a political
                demonstration during the ’60s. Farther east you see rows of State Street pubs and
                restaurants and the bleached dome of the Wisconsin state capitol. On the other side
                of the hill, another part of campus, dedicated to the agricultural and health sciences,
                twists along Lake Mendota. But students from both sides of the hill congregate in
                the old student union, Memorial Union, where political arguments and backgammon games can rage all
                night. Outside on the
                union’s veranda, students can look
                out at the sailboats in summer or iceboats in winter.
                <br><br>Distribution requirements vary among the different schools and academic
                departments, but they are uniformly rigorous, with science and math courses
                required for B.A. students, and a foreign language for virtually everyone. All students
                must fulfill a three-part graduation requirement in quantitative reasoning, communication, and ethnic
                studies. Students
                who prefer the academic road less traveled can
                opt for the Integrated Liberal Studies certificate program, which allows them to fulfill several gen eds
                with a series
                of related, interdisciplinary courses, rather than
                taking electives at random.
                <br><br>Madison’s academic climate is demanding. “There are a lot of smart people
                studying here,” notes one student. A list of first-rate academic programs at Madison
                would constitute a college catalog elsewhere. There are 70 programs considered in
                the top 10 nationally. Some highlights include education, agriculture, communication, biological
                sciences, and social
                sciences. The most popular majors are economics, biology, computer science, and psychology. Due to
                overcrowding, some
                popular
                fields, such as business and engineering, have more selective admissions criteria
                than others. Although many classes are large, 43 percent have fewer than 20 students. Professors at
                Madison are
                certainly among the nation’s best, with National
                Academy of Science members and Guggenheim fellows scattered liberally among
                the departments.
                <br><br>While the university’s size can be daunting, harried freshmen aren’t left to fend
                for themselves. The university offers a number of first-year programs designed to
                ease the transition into college life. A first-year seminar encourages students to
                examine learning strategies; connect with faculty, staff, and peers; and become
                familiar with campus resources. First-Year Interest Groups (FIGs) consist of 20 firstyear students who
                may live in the
                same residence hall or “residential neighborhood”
                and who also enroll in a cluster of three classes together. Each FIG cluster of courses
                has a central theme; the central or “synthesizing” course integrates content from the
                other two classes. After freshman year, many students participate in internships,
                and 27 percent choose to study abroad in programs all over the world, including
                France, Brazil, India, Israel, and Thailand. Thirty-eight percent conduct undergraduate research.
                <br><br>If there is a common characteristic among Madison undergraduates, it is assertiveness. “It’s
                easy to get
                lost in the
                crowd here, so you have to be fairly strong
                and confident,” declares one student. “No one holds your hand.” The flip side is that “anyone can fit
                in, you just have to find your own niche.” Sixty-six percent of
                undergraduates are from Wisconsin, and 9 percent are international. The school is
                a heartland of progressive politics, and Madison’s reputation as a haven for liberals
                remains intact. “Students here are called liberal because they are eager and willing to
                change and are continually looking for newer and better ideas,” explains one activist. Asian Americans
                make up 6 percent
                of the student body, Hispanics 5 percent,
                African Americans 2 percent, and multiracial students 3 percent. Academic merit
                scholarships averaging $5,300 are awarded each year, along with more than 350
                athletic scholarships.
                <br><br>Twenty-five percent of undergrads, mostly freshmen, reside in university housing. Dorms are
                either co-ed or single sex
                and come equipped with laundry facilities,
                game rooms, and lounges. Most also have a cafeteria. The student union offers two
                meal plans, and there are plenty of restaurants and fast-food places nearby. Escort
                services for those walking and those needing a ride help keep students safe on
                campus. A variety of programs and groups, such as U Got This! and We’re Better
                Than That, are working to educate the community on preventing sexual assault and
                supporting survivors.
                <br><br>One old standby for social life that is still as popular as ever is the student union,
                which hosts bands, shows, and so forth and provides a great atmosphere in which
                to hang out. There are more film clubs than
                anyone can follow, and everyone has a favorite
                bar. Nine percent of the men and 8 percent of
                the women go Greek. “Frat parties are a very
                popular break from the bar scene,” quips one expert on both options. Madison
                (a.k.a. Madtown) is an excellent college town and has been the stomping ground
                for many fine rock ’n’ roll and blues bands on the road to fame. Volunteering is a
                tradition here; the university consistently tops the list for providing the Peace
                Corps with the most entrants of any college or university in the nation. Nature
                enthusiasts can lose themselves in the university’s 12,000-acre nature preserve or
                hit nearby ski slopes.
                <br><br>The students at this Big Ten school show “tons of interest” in sports, especially
                hockey and football, and especially when the Badgers try to rout the University of
                Michigan’s Wolverines. The Badgers have produced a number of Big Ten champions, most notably men’s
                cross-country, men’s
                and women’s soccer, and women’s ice hockey. Bucky Badger apparel, emblazoned with slogans ranging from
                the
                urbane to the decidedly uncouth, is ubiquitous. However, the much-acclaimed
                marching band may outdo all the teams in popularity. Recreational sports are
                another favorite pastime, with 26 intramural and 44 club sports offered at varying
                levels of competitiveness.
                <br><br>One of the best and most well-rounded state schools anywhere, Madison remains
                a school that students sum up as “diverse, intellectual, fashionable, and moderately
                hedonistic.” And these are the qualities that attract bright and energetic students
                from everywhere. “You feel you’re accepted for who you are no matter what,” says
                one student. “It’s so nice to just be yourself.”
